##  Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing RNA-seq gene expression data from cancer samples.  
The goal is to explore global expression patterns, identify top expressed genes, and visualize sample variability using PCA and correlation heatmaps.

---

##  Features
- Data loading and preprocessing from CSV files  
- Summary statistics and expression distribution plots  
- Identification of top 10 most expressed genes  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for sample clustering  
- Correlation heatmap for overall similarity visualization

---

## Requirements
Install the required Python packages before running the notebook:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn numpy
```

---

## ▶ How to Use
1. Place your data files (`data.csv`, `labels.csv`) in the same directory as the notebook.  
2. Open the notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook RNAseq_Full_Cancer_Analysis_SahilBilal.ipynb
   ```
3. Run all cells sequentially to generate plots and results.  

---

##  Output Files
- **full_pca_coordinates.csv** → PCA results for all samples  
- **full_labels_for_pca.csv** → Labels matched with PCA results  
- **Plots** → Automatically generated inline
